        <li>9-10 dried lasagna sheets</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the cheese sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>75g/2.5oz plain flour</li>
        <li>75g/2.5oz butter, cubed</li>
        <li>750ml/1.25 pint milk, semi-skimmed or full-fat</li>
        <li>125g/4.5oz mature cheddar, coarsely grated</li>
        <li>75g/2.5oz grated mozarella, or extra cheddar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Put the peppers, courgette and sweet potato into a large baking tray. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil, season with salt and pepper and toss together.</li>

        <li>Roast for 30 minutes, or until softened and lightly browned.</li>

        <li>While the vegetables are roasting, heat the remaining oil in a large saucepan and gently fry the onion for 5 minutes, stirring regularly.</li>

        <li>Add the chilli and garlic and cook for a few seconds more. Stir in the tomatoes, Italian seasoning (or dried oregano) and crumbled stock cube. Pour over the water and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly. Set aside.</li>

        <li>For the cheese sauce, put the flour, butter and milk in a large saucepan and place over a medium heat. Whisk constantly with a large metal whisk until the sauce is thickened and smooth. (Use a silicone covered whisk if cooking in a non-stick pan.) Stir in roughly two-thirds of the cheeses and season to taste.</li>

        <li>Take the vegetables out of the oven and add to the pan with the tomato sauce. Stir in the spinach and cook together for 3 minutes. Season with salt and lots of ground black pepper.</li>

        <li>Spoon a third of the vegetable mixture over the base of a 2½-3 litre/4½-5¼ pint ovenproof lasagne dish and cover with a single layer of lasagne. Top with another third of the vegetable mixture (don't worry if it doesn't cover evenly) and a second layer of lasagne.</li>

        <li>Pour over just under half of the cheese sauce and very gently top with the remaining vegetable mixture. Finish with a final layer of lasagne and the rest of the cheese sauce. Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top.</li>

        <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the pasta has softened and the topping is golden brown and bubbling. Stand for 5 minutes before cutting to allow the filling to settle.</li>
    </ol>
